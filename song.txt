Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
D-d-d-d, cooler than me
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
D-d-d-d, cooler than me

Designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
Cooler than me
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-

D-d-d-d, cooler than me
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
Designer shades just to hide-
D-d-d-d, c-cooler than me
